# To install the package (without messing around with the wheels):

- Download `annoy.zip`
- Enter directory where downloaded
- Expand archive
- Run `pip install annoy/annoy-1.17.3`
  - (I used uv with `uv pip install --system annoy/annoy-1.17.3` - UV must be downloaded via `pip install uv` or otherwise for this)
- Delete archive & annoy folder
